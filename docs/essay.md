# Organization

- Why is Sketchpad important and what can we learn from it?
- What can you use Sketchpad to do?

  - Nefertite
  - Bridge

- How was it built?

  - Chicken/hen as object- or generic-like programming style
    - Three ways: type-instance, namespace-member, and relation of siblings
    - Relation to OOP, parametric polymorphism, etc.
    - (Give a good visualization that uses each type)
      > "It is to be hoped that future workers can either grasp the power of generality at once and strive for it or have the courage to stumble along a trail like mine until they achieve it."
  - Merging: recursive merging of visual elements is logical unification (is this a ridiculous idea?)
  - Constraint solver: first and second version, doing what's logical to UI user rather than mathematically precise

- Odds and ends
  - Meta-object protocol side comment
    > "I considered making it belong to itself so that continued upward searching through the generic structure would appear to reach an unending string of UNIVERSE blocks, but I could find no solid reason for so doing. Further work may develop one, of course." (p.53)
  - ... re-review notes for other interesting side comments
  - Raster font
  - Concurrency bugs (p.48)
  - Windowing: zoom/pan so display shows different portions of underlying document
  - Pseudo pen location (p.66) similar to iPad cursor (probably other examples)
  - Display twinkling (p.68)
  - "Natural" v reverse scrolling:
    > "It is possible to think of moving the scope window above the page or moving the drawing beneath the window." (p.74)
  - The first lazy programmer:
    > "The rewards that came from implementing general functions are so great that the author has become reluctant to write any programs for specific jobs." (p.87)
