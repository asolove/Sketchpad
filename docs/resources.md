    May have interesting material on someone else learning to use the system and expand its codebase. - [Video of Sketchpad III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ZsiBMnGSg&list=PLKTTWvMgeg0ZJTk-3DY_pwvoih9_gsAw4) showing a single 3d object projected in multiple ways
  - [Photographs from Lincoln Labs archive](https://tx-2.github.io/photographs) showing TX-2 and Sketchpad in use. These are much higher-resolution images than the ones you normally see, and some are in color.

    Shows interactive usage and pretty clearly demonstrates the "twinkle" display mode.

It appears to have 4 pages of Sketchpad and recreation material.
    - [Recreation of Sketchpad](http://dcardo.com/projects/archaeology_of_cad/index.html) has pictures and video of a physically accurate recreation, including a light pen, buttons, and a physical console matching the original.
    - [Algorithmic Tectonics: How Cold War Era Research Shaped Our Imagination of Design](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ad.1546): seems to be a cultural study of how DoD funding for e.g. Sketchpad led to changes in building design and production
  - [Curiosity and Possibility: The Ivan Sutherland Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPsFPmgT0YM)
    A retrospective video made by the National Inventors' Hall of Fame

- Applications, callbacks to, and inspired by Sketchpad
  - [sutherland](https://github.com/alexwarth/sutherland) is a recreation of the bridge simulation. It has a very interesting constraint solver implementation and several of the bridge images pre-programmed. From what I can tell, it doesn't have arbitrary user input to construct your own pictures or constraints.
  - ["Sketch Tool Usability : Allowing the user to disengage"](): a subsequent tool that takes some inspiration from Sketchpad
  - ["Special Issue on Constraints"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Introduction-to-the-Special-Issue-Cruz-Marriott/81b02fbb7accd71245cdbdbb8f78188c9b70e825)
  - ["Doing with images makes symbols"](https://archive.org/details/AlanKeyD1987?start=249.5) is a talk by Alan Kay
  - ["The future of programming"](https://worrydream.com/dbx/) is a talk by Bret Victor that discusses Sketchpad as an example of direct manipulation and constraints to accomplish goals without direct writing of code.

      - There is an interesting blog post response and a [comment section](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/bret-victors-inventing-on-principle-and-the-trade-off-between-usability-and-learning/#div-comment-9525) in which Alan Kay and Bret Victor show up and discuss the ideas, with a passing mention of Sketchpad.
  - [Hacker News comment by Alan Kay](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10967103) describing the impact of Sketchpad on Smalltalk and other Xerox PARC projects.
