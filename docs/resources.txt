  - [Sketchpad III](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11559) a thesis adding 3D to Sketchpad, from around the same time.
      May have interesting material on someone else learning to use the system and expand its codebase.

- Second-hand demos or voiceovers
  - [Historical retrospective with 1963 demo clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6orsmFndx_o)
    Shows interactive usage and pretty clearly demonstrates the "twinkle" display mode.

It appears to have 4 pages of Sketchpad and recreation material.
		- [Recreation of Sketchpad](http://dcardo.com/projects/archaeology_of_cad/index.html) has pictures and video of a physically accurate recreation, including a light pen, buttons, and a physical console matching the original.
		- [Algorithmic Tectonics: How Cold War Era Research Shaped Our Imagination of Design](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ad.1546): seems to be a cultural study of how DoD funding for e.g. Sketchpad led to changes in building design and production
  - [Curiosity and Possibility: The Ivan Sutherland Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPsFPmgT0YM)
    A retrospective video made by the National Inventors' Hall of Fame

- Applications, callbacks to, and inspired by Sketchpad
	- ["Sketch Tool Usability : Allowing the user to disengage"](): a subsequent tool that takes some inspiration from Sketchpad
