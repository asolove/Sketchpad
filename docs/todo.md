# TODOs

## Sketchpad itself

### Thoughtful doing tasks

- [ ] Implement copy picture (without merge/tool UI)
  - [x] Basic recursive copy
  - [ ] Scale/rotate/place: transform coordinates on copy
- [ ] Implement Mergeable for other types
- [ ] Add instance attacher constraints
- [ ] Tool UI
  - Toolbar to show current tool, and select options (which picture to copy: names? previews?)
  - Instance/Copy tools allow picking place, zoom, rotation when adding picture
- [ ] UI bugs
  - Need a way to "end" a line and just kill the currently-moving point/line.
  - Same for part-constructed circles.
- [ ] Constraint tool works on other constraint types (how?)
- [ ] Implement Drawable for Constraints (optionally)

### Hammock tasks

- [ ] Serialization or DSL format for compactly describing complex images (naming?)

## Essays

- [ ] Review notes and annotations on the thesis and add to essay outline

## Launch prep

- [x] Find ~5 reviewers
- [x] Site design (typography-centric)
- Launch comms plan
