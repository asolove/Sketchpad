# TODOs

## Sketchpad itself

### Straightforward tasks

- [ ] Re-read thesis section on displaying digits: how are they stored/calculated?

### Thoughtful doing tasks

- [ ] Serialization or DSL format for compactly describing complex images (naming?)
- [ ] Add instance attacher constraints
- [ ] Calculate object pointed to at each display point

  - [ ] Near intersection of lines, it points at both and will create a new point on both

  - [ ] Tool for adding instances (how do we identify pictures)

- [ ] UI bugs
  - Need a way to "end" a line and just kill the currently-moving point/line.

### Hammock tasks

- [ ] Re-read to understand the maze-solving technique for constraint performance
- [ ] Re-read to understand how the bridge simulation worked with definition copying

## Essays

- [ ] Review notes and annotations on the thesis and add to essay outline

## Launch prep

- Find ~5 reviewers
- Site design (typography-centric)
- Launch comms plan
