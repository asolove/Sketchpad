# TODOs

## Sketchpad itself

### Straightforward tasks

- [ ] Re-read thesis section on displaying digits: how are they stored/calculated?
- [ ] Add pan controls
- [ ] Add point on circle constraint

### Thoughtful doing tasks

- [ ] Add instance attacher constraints
- [ ] Calculate object pointed to at each display point
  - Near intersection of lines, it points at both and will create a new point on both
- [ ] Design control states/modes
  - [ ] Build the pen tool for adding points/lines and the circle tool for arcs
  - [ ] Tool for adding instances (how do we identify pictures)
  - [ ] Build the move tool (moving items don't get added to the objects pointed to list)

### Hammock tasks

- [ ] Re-read to understand the maze-solving technique for constraint performance
- [ ] Re-read to understand how the bridge simulation worked with definition copying

## Essays

- [ ] Review notes and annotations on the thesis and add to essay outline

## Launch prep

- Find ~5 reviewers
- Site design (typography-centric)
- Launch comms plan
