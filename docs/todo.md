# TODOs

## Sketchpad itself

### Thoughtful doing tasks

- [ ] Add instance attacher constraints
- [ ] Implement Mergeable for other types
- [ ] Tool for adding instances and copies (how do we name and pick the pictures?)
- [ ] Constraint tool works on other constraint types (how?)
- [ ] Implement Drawable for Constraints (optionally)

- [ ] UI bugs
  - Need a way to "end" a line and just kill the currently-moving point/line.
  - Same for part-constructed circles.

### Hammock tasks

- [ ] Re-read to understand the maze-solving technique for constraint performance
- [ ] Re-read to understand how the bridge simulation worked with definition copying
- [ ] Serialization or DSL format for compactly describing complex images (naming?)

## Essays

- [ ] Review notes and annotations on the thesis and add to essay outline

## Launch prep

- Find ~5 reviewers
- Site design (typography-centric)
- Launch comms plan
