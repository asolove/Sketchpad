# Sketchpad

A ClojureScript recreation of Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad, the first graphical user interface program, and still one of the best.

## Status

* DONE: Basic drawing of points, circles, and lines, rendered to <canvas>
* TODO: update the UI to have real affordances
* TODO: masters and instances
* TODO: constraints
  * The original user a linear constraint solver and a method for creating numerical approximation of non-linear constraints. The description in the thesis is not yet clear to me. We could alternately implement a quadratic constraint solver.
