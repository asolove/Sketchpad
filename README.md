# Sketchpad

A ClojureScript recreation of Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad, the first graphical user interface program, and still one of the best.

## Status

* DONE: Basic drawing of points, circles, and lines, rendered to <canvas>
* TODO: add arcs, erasure, numbers, other drawable items
* TODO: update the UI to have real affordances
* TODO: masters and instances
* IN PROGRESS: constraints
  * DONE: reproduce the basic interface of Sketchpad's energy-relaxation solver.
  * TODO: debug possible infinite loops, perf problems in naive relaxation solver. Make constraint solver async, yielding control so events can be handled.
  * TODO: add constraint types: midpoint, perpendicular, same length
  * TODO: add a UI for adding and viewing constraints
  * ?: reproduce the faster solver method that identifies a DAG of constraint dependencies
